# avatar-practice
**From the [Go Bootcamp](https://github.com/GoBootcamp/avatarme):** Given a personal information such as an email address, IP address, or a public key, the program you will write needs to generate a unique avatar. Imagine that you are building a new application and you want all of your users to have a default and unique avatar. The package you will write will allow the generation of such avatars. GitHub recently used such an approach and generates an identicon for all new users who don't have a gravatar account attached.
